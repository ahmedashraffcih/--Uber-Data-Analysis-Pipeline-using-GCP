# Uber Data Analysis Pipeline using GCP


## ü™Ñ Introduction

This project focuses on performing data analytics on Uber data using various tools and technologies within the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ecosystem. The project utilizes GCP Storage, Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio to achieve the data engineering objectives.

## üëè Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

- Perform data analytics on Uber data
- Build a data pipeline for data transformation and integration
- Store the transformed data in Google BigQuery
- Visualize the data using Looker Studio for insights and analysis

## üíø Project Datasets:

TLC Trip Record Data
Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. 

Here is the dataset used - https://github.com/darshilparmar/uber-etl-pipeline-data-engineering-project/blob/main/data/uber_data.csv

## ‚ö° Project Steps

1. Understanding the Data:
   - Analyze the Uber dataset and handle any special cases or considerations.

2. Loading CSV Data into Pandas DataFrame:
   - Load the Uber dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for easy data manipulation and analysis using Python.

3. Creating a Data Model:
   - Design a data model to represent the relationships between different entities within the dataset.

4. Data Transformation:
   - Perform various transformations on the data, such as adjusting data types, removing duplicates, resetting indexes, reordering columns, and mapping specific fields.

5. Creating Dimensions and Fact Table:
   - Based on the data model, create dimensions and a fact table to facilitate efficient data analysis and reporting.

6. Uploading Data to GCS:
   - Upload the transformed dataset to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

7. Deploying Mage Data Pipeline:
   - Deploy Mage, an open-source data pipeline tool, on a Compute Engine instance to automate the data transformation process.

8. Building the Pipeline in Mage:
   - Construct a comprehensive data pipeline in Mage to orchestrate the required data transformations and integrations.

9. Loading Data into BigQuery:
   - Load the transformed data into Google BigQuery, a scalable and flexible data warehousing solution within GCP.
